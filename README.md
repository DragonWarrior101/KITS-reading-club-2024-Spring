# ETH, Chaos and nonequilibrium 

This reading club mainly consists of junior graduate students in KITS. In 2024 spring, we'll discuss various topics of ETH, Chaos and nonequilibrium.

We have scheduled to thoroughly read sections 1 through 4 of the review paper titled [From quantum chaos and eigenstate thermalization to statistical mechanics
 and thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06411)  And subsequently, we will discuss some special topics pertaining to the scheme.



## Goal

- To introduce and discuss the concepts of ETH, chaos, and nonequilibrium in the context of quantum systems
- have basic knowledge of ETH
- To explore the connections between quantum chaos, eigenstate thermalization, and statistical mechanics/thermodynamics
- promote reading papers and presentation skills



## Topics

- review: [From quantum chaos and eigenstate thermalization to statistical mechanics
 and thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06411)
