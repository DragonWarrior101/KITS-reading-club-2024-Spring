# ETH, Chaos and nonequilibrium 

This reading club mainly consists of junior graduate students in KITS. In 2024 spring, we'll discuss various topics of ETH, Chaos and nonequilibrium.

We plan to 



## Goal

- To introduce and discuss the concepts of ETH, chaos, and nonequilibrium in the context of quantum systems
- have basic knowledge of ETH
- To explore the connections between quantum chaos, eigenstate thermalization, and statistical mechanics/thermodynamics
- promote reading papers and presentation skills



## Topics

- review: [From quantum chaos and eigenstate thermalization to statistical mechanics
 and thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06411) 

  Useful resources: [Mark Srednicki - Quantum chaos and eigenstate thermalization](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C4GREsvpzA0&pp=ygUuZWlnZW5zdGF0ZSB0aGVybWFsaXphdGlvbiBoeXBvdGhlc2lzIHNyZWRuaWNraQ%3D%3D)




## When

Every week on Saturday at 10am BJT.




## Where

- Room 401, Building 7.

- OR room 302 if we forget to make an appointment ahead.
